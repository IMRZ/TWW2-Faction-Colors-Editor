# Total War Warhammer II Faction Colors Editor

## What is it:
This program allows to customize banner and uniform colors of every faction in the game.

## How to use it:
1) Select the faction you want to edit; 
2) Change the faction banner and/or uniform colors as you desire;
3) Save your changes pressing the Save button;
4) You can use the enable/disable switch to quickly activate/deactivate alla changes;

## Tips
1) You can use the search box to search for a a faction, or to select all factions of the same tipe (by putting the minus sign '-' before the 3 letters):

  It's also possible to select only the edited factions by writing '*' in the search box.

2) You can drag and drop a faction from the left into your currently selected faction to copy its color values:

## How it works
The program creates a .pack file with the new color values and adds it to the TW Launcher mod list, already enabled.

## Known problems
For some reason changes to the elves banner colors won't be reflected in the game; I've tried to change the color manually without this tool but couldn't manage to do it, so I have no idea how to fix this.

Changes made by this program could be overwrited by some faction reskins, since those too change factions colors;
